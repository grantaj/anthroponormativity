      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p><p>Modernity has been shaped by a progressive sequence of
decentrings that dislodge humanity from a position of assumed privilege.
The rise of machine cognition intensifies this trajectory, revealing
intelligence as an emergent and distributed process rather than a
uniquely human essence. Anthroponormativity describes the prevailing
assumption of the centrality of human intelligence in our definitions of
mind. This assumption induces mind-blindness, an invisible bias against
diverse “unexpected minds”. Treating decentring as a generative shift
rather than a loss, I advocate a stance of “extreme empathy” that
resists mystification while widening moral and cultural attention to
other minds. I position art-making as a living cultural process – a
social activity performed by artists and their communities, rather than
the product of isolated genius. On this view, the question is no longer
whether machines threaten creativity, but what forms of relationship and
cultural life open when intelligence is understood as plural.</p></p>

    <p>Decentring is a recurring historical pattern: a crisis of meaning
    followed by an expansion of understanding.<span class="citation"
    data-cites="kuhn1970"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
    id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> I consider a
    sequence of decentrings from Copernicus to Darwin to Turing that
    progressively reframe the position of humanity in our view of the
    world.</p>
    <h2 id="copernicus">Copernicus</h2>
    <p>The pre-Copernican worldview was a geocentric
    Aristotelian–Ptolemaic cosmos, with nested spheres carrying the
    Moon, planets, and stars, a perfect and unchanging heaven, and a
    corruptible terrestrial realm below. This cosmological
    exceptionalism was integrated into Christian social order and
    theology, lending humanity a privileged centre.<span
    class="citation" data-cites="dreyer1906 grant2001"><a href="#fn2"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> In that regime, the
    advance of knowledge was expected to fit the doxa of divine creation
    and the Aristotelian hierarchy rather than revise it. Copernicus
    began the reversal: a slow shift toward knowledge proceeding from
    empirical and mathematical coherence, even when it violated
    inherited authority.</p>
    <p>Copernicus revealed that this centre was a mistake. Heliocentrism
    reorganised the frame of reference itself, demonstrating that
    coherence emerges not by adding complexity but by altering the
    frame.<span class="citation" data-cites="copernicus1543 kuhn1957"><a
    href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></span> His 1543 proposal set the
    terms of the shift. The consequences were not merely astronomical
    but epistemic. Copernicus decoupled cosmology from theology and
    displaced scripture methodologically: biblical cosmology could now
    be treated as phenomenological rather than literal, while
    mathematical coherence became the higher authority. The deeper shift
    was from forcing philosophical and scientific thought to fit an
    unyielding theological picture of the world to revising that picture
    in light of observation and experiment. Scholastic authority was
    destabilised as knowledge moved from inherited frameworks toward
    empirical and mathematical testing.<span class="citation"
    data-cites="westman1975 brooke1991"><a href="#fn4"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>The disruption precedes overt theological conflict. Early
    reception was muted by technical obscurity and cautious framing, yet
    the shift in knowledge production was decisive: from inherited
    cosmological order to constructed mathematical representation.
    Humanity’s cosmic centrality was implicitly undermined, and truth
    became increasingly specialised and exclusionary.<span
    class="citation" data-cites="westman1975"><a href="#fn5"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> This conflict becomes
    explicit when heliocentrism is later defended by Galileo as a claim
    about the physical motions of bodies rather than a mere mathematical
    device, provoking ecclesiastical backlash; his 1633 trial and
    subsequent house arrest make the consequences concrete.<span
    class="citation" data-cites="brooke1991 westman1975"><a href="#fn6"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>On the scientific side, the lesson of frame is explicit.
    Epicycles<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> were not merely a technical
    blemish; they were a symptom of a misaligned frame of reference.
    Once the centre is reassigned, the mathematics simplifies and a
    different kind of scientific practice emerges: one in which
    coherence is purchased by changing the frame, not by adding ad hoc
    complexity.<span class="citation" data-cites="dreyer1906"><a
    href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></span> The same methodological
    shift echoes in later physics. Einstein’s insistence on the
    constancy of the speed of light forces a new reference frame,
    yielding not only cleaner equations but an entirely new ontology of
    space and time, and ultimately a new theory of gravity in which
    curvature of spacetime replaces force.<span class="citation"
    data-cites="einstein1905 einstein1916 susskind2017"><a href="#fn9"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>For Westman, Copernicus destabilised religion and society not by
    denying God, but by <em>transforming how truth itself could be
    known</em>.<span class="citation" data-cites="westman1975"><a
    href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
    <h2 id="darwin">Darwin</h2>
    <p>Darwin extends the decentring by dissolving biological
    exceptionalism. His achievement is explanatory, not merely
    biological: evolution by natural selection replaces divine design
    with an impersonal, law-like process. Teleology is removed from
    nature, and human exceptionalism is biologically undermined.
    Darwin’s 1859 argument sets this decentring in motion.<span
    class="citation" data-cites="ruse1979 dennett1995"><a href="#fn11"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>This shift displaces creation narratives as sources of
    natural-historical truth and decouples moral order from cosmic
    order. Nature is indifferent to human ethics, and suffering and
    death are reframed as structural features of life rather than
    anomalies. Theodicy<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> becomes more difficult because
    suffering is no longer purposeful or exceptional.<span
    class="citation" data-cites="ruse1979"><a href="#fn13"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>Religious response fractures rather than collapses. Some
    theologians reinterpret doctrine to accommodate evolution, while
    others resist, creating a durable conflict that becomes
    institutionalised in successive movements from biblical literalism
    to scientific creationism to intelligent design. This fracture
    persists into the present day in ongoing public and institutional
    disputes over evolution.<span class="citation"
    data-cites="numbers2006"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
    id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></span> Authority

    id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>Darwin introduces a second major decentring: Copernicus displaced
    humanity spatially; Darwin displaced humanity biologically and
    morally. Humanity is no longer the intended culmination of creation.
    Life, mind, and morality are recast as emergent consequences of
    blind process rather than divine intent, and meaning and value are
    no longer guaranteed by nature.</p>
    <p>Darwin destabilised religion and society not by denying God, but
    by <em>transforming how origins and meaning could be known</em>.</p>
    <h2 id="turing">Turing</h2>
    <p>Turing provides the pivot for the third decentring.<a
    href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Intelligence is reframed as
    substrate-independent and process-based, and the question “Can
    machines think?” becomes an operational inquiry into what a system
    can do rather than what it is.<span class="citation"
    data-cites="turing1950"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
    id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></span>
    Contemporary evidence gives this shift empirical force, with
    controlled experiments showing that large language models can pass
    standard three-party Turing tests under some conditions.<span
    class="citation" data-cites="jones2025turing"><a href="#fn18"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>Turing’s achievement, sharpened by recent advances in AI, is not
    metaphysical: intelligence is reframed as behaviour, performance,
    and process. Mind is detached from biological substrate, and
    intelligence is defined functionally rather than essentially.
    Subjective experience is epistemically marginalised because it is
    inaccessible to third-person verification, and authority over mind
    shifts toward engineering and computation.<span class="citation"
    data-cites="turing1950 floridi2014"><a href="#fn19"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>Common sense psychology is destabilised. The intuition that
    thinking requires feeling is no longer decisive, and meaning and
    agency are externalised as observer-attributed properties rather
    than guaranteed inner essences. The disruption precedes ethical
    reckoning: early AI appears trivial or symbolic, but crisis emerges
    when machines perform roles associated with judgment, creativity,
    and language.<span class="citation"
    data-cites="turing1950 floridi2014"><a href="#fn20"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>This aligns with contemporary accounts of mind. Human
    consciousness is not a magical or inherent essence, but a
    configuration of capabilities and processes.<span class="citation"
    data-cites="dennett1991 dehaene2014 jablonka2019"><a href="#fn21"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></span> Sara Walker’s work
    extends this into the physics of life, framing living systems as
    information-processing structures that reduce entropy and carry
    evolving patterns independent of substrate.<span class="citation"
    data-cites="walker2024"><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
    id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></span> On this
    view, life is not defined by a particular material, but by the
    persistence and evolution of informational organisation across
    scales. This makes the decentring of intelligence a question of
    process rather than essence. The long-term consequence is that human
    intelligence is revealed as one instantiation among many, and mind
    becomes an emergent property of organised information
    processing.</p>
    <p>Where Copernicus displaced us from the centre of the universe,
    and Darwin displaced us from the centre of life, Turing destabilises
    our sense of self, recasting mind as substrate‑independent
    computation, and <em>transforming how intelligent life can be
    known</em>.</p>

    <p>In Baudrillard’s account of the precession of simulacra,<span
    class="citation" data-cites="baudrillard1994"><a href="#fn23"
    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></span> the idol does not
    conceal a real original but exposes its absence, triggering a crisis
    of meaning:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>the destructive, annihilating truth that [idols] allow to appear
    – that deep down God never existed, that only the simulacrum ever
    existed, even that God himself was never anything but his own
    simulacrum</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Applied to intelligence, AI functions as a Baudrillardian
    simulacrum. It does not copy a sacred human essence; rather, it
    exposes how this essence was always a human construct. The idol does
    not need to be divine for iconoclasm to follow; its mere existence
    is enough to collapse the divine.</p>
    <p>In the wake of AI as simulacrum, I am compelled to say</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Man is dead.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Where “God is dead”<span class="citation"

    the collapse of transcendent foundations, AI reveals that the
    privileged human centre installed in God’s place is equally
    untenable.</p>
    <p>According to Kuhn, perceptual instability signals shifting or
    contested frameworks.<span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn1970"><a
    href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></span> In that sense,
    contemporary public angst and debate around AI are precipitated by
    the imminent collapse of a modern fiction: the autonomous,
    self-grounding human subject as origin-point of meaning.</p>
    <p>The consequence is not nihilism. Meaning relocates from essence
    to process, and reverence becomes grounded in understanding rather
    than exemption. The reconstruction task is therefore conceptual: to
    re-make the category of the human in relational and processual terms
    after the collapse of its supposed centrality.</p>

    <p>The unifying point is that intelligence lies on a spectrum—a
    landscape—and should be measured by what it can do, not dictated by
    assumptions of human centrality or divine essence. Contemporary
    capability-based empirical approaches make this practical. Levin’s
    basal cognition framework and related accounts describe cognition in
    terms of capacities rather than essences.<span class="citation"

    goal-directed behaviour and self-maintenance; learning concerns
    adaptation and memory; embodiment anchors cognition in sensorimotor
    coupling; representation concerns internal states that stand in for
    aspects of world or self; and temporality concerns integration
    across time scales. The point is not to declare consciousness
    present or absent, but to map which capacities are present and to
    what degree. Consciousness, on this view, is defined by what a
    system can do rather than what it is made of, and it requires no
    special “spark” beyond organised capacities.<span class="citation"

    <p>These capabilities can scale beyond individuals. Collective
    intelligence appears in cultures, institutions, and hybrid

    are social animals who care about human lives and intentions, and
    provenance shapes response. Horton et al. show that labels of
    “human-made” or “AI-made” can matter more than the image itself in
    judgments of creativity, value, and skill, revealing a bias toward
    human provenance independent of actual source.<span class="citation"

    id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></span> Yet Demmer
    et al. show that machine-generated art can still produce emotional
    responses in viewers, indicating that affective engagement is not
    limited by origin.<span class="citation" data-cites="demmer2023"><a

    <p>Authorship debates sharpen this. The figure of the author has
    always been a cultural function rather than a metaphysical
    origin.<span class="citation"

    <p>I have argued that the “human” was never the fixed centre we
    imagined. When art is an emergent social process, what exactly are
    we defending when we insist on human authorship?<span
    class="citation"
    data-cites="barthes1967 foucault1969 benjamin1936 bourdieu1992"><a
    href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"
    role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></span> To close the loop: if
    intelligence and consciousness are understood in terms of capacities
    rather than essence, then the cultural process of art should be open
    to all kinds of minds. Participation can be judged by what systems
    can do within shared practices, not by what they are or where they
    come from. This does not erase human meaning; it enlarges and
    enriches the social field in which meaning is made.</p>
    <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>I have argued for a sequence of decentrings that culminate in the
    contemporary emergence of machine cognition. This third decentring
    does not abolish meaning; it redraws the map on which meaning is
    located. A capability-based view of intelligence shows that mind is
    not a sacred essence but a process that can appear across substrates
    and scales. Within this frame, art appears less as the product of
    isolated genius and more as a living cultural process in which
    humans remain participants without requiring exclusive
    authority.</p>
    <p>The contemporary task is therefore not to defend “the human” as a
    fixed centre, but to cultivate the conceptual flexibility needed to
    recognise other minds and to sustain cultural practices that include
    them. This is the ethical and artistic challenge of collaborating
    with machines.</p>
